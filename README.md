# Javascript-Space-Invaders
My second game in Javascript, made on 4k display but responsive so it is ready to be displayed on smaller screens such as 1080p.

Space invaders is classic or better said retro game where you are in control of a spaceship which must eliminate all oncoming aliens.
In my version of the game you control spaceship with left and right arrows to move laterally and when you think it's the best time to shoot, just press spacebar and missile will fly towards aliens.
There are 30 aliens or invaders that must be eliminated. To take the game to another level of competitiveness I added stopwatch so you can see how much time you need to destroy all of them invaders.
To avoid glitches and unwanted results I limited shooting system to allow you to ahoot missile on every 0.5 second.

Thank you for your time and enjoy,
Kranjex.
